Resolver agent
===================

Command line interface
-----------------------
Agent's actions can be invoked using a proxy bash script present at path **/etc/whalebone/cli/cli.sh**. This script calls a python script which handles the execution of the following agent actions: 

* **sysinfo** - returns the system status data in JSON format.
	* Parameters: None
	* Output: tested categories on tested key can have two values **OK** and **FAIL**

Each of those actions execute similarly named actions and the status of that action, or output of that action, is printed. The **list** and **run** actions are intended for the scenario when a confirmation of a certain action is required. The action list shows the action that should be executed and the changes that would be done by that action for containers specified in that action. This serves as an example of what would happen if the awaiting action would have been executed. The run action then executes the awaiting action and cleans up afterwards. 

The actions of **upgrade** and **create** use the docker-compose template present in the agent container to create/upgrade the desired container. This template is mounted in the volume **/etc/whalebone/agent** if the user decides to change it. However this change needs to be done also to the template present at **portal.whalebone.io**, if not than the local changes will be overwritten from the cloud during next upgrade. 

The bash script should be invoked like this: ``./cli.sh action param1 param2 param3``. **Action** is the action name and **parameters** are the action parameters. Only actions for container stop, remove and upgrade use these and specify what containers should be affected by the respective action.

Strict mode
------------------
The agent's default option is to execute actions from the cloud management immediately. It is however possible to enable manual confirmation of requests. This gives the administrator control over when and what gets executed. To enable the resolver Strict mode, please create a ticket to Whalebone support.

To list changes the request introduces the cli option **list** option should be used. To execute the request use cli option **run**. There can only be one  request pending in the queue. New request from the cloud will ovewrite the previous one, but the new one holds the full desired state anyway. To delete waiting request use cli option **delete_request**. The actions that can be persisted are: **upgrade**, **create** and **suicide**. Please see examples of the CLI command usage.

* **list** - lists the awaiting command and the changes that would be made to the containers specified in the awaiting action, this action is intended for human check hence it's format 
	* Parameters: None
	* Example: ./cli.sh list
	

.. code-block:: lua

	-------------------------------
	Changes for resolver
	New value for label: resolver-1.1.1
	
	  	Old value for label: resolver-1.0.0
	-------------------------------
	
* **run** - executes the awaiting command
	* Parameters: none
	* Example: ./cli.sh run

.. sourcecode:: js

	{'resolver': {'status': 'success'}

* **delete_request** - deletes the awaiting request
	* Parameters: none
	* Example: ./cli.sh delete_request

.. code-block:: lua

	Pending configuration request deleted.
