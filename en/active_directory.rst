Why Active Directory Integration with Whalebone DNS is Beneficial
DNS Lookup Integration, also known as AD Integration, offers customers a powerful way to enhance their network management and security by seamlessly connecting their Active Directory infrastructure with Whalebone DNS. This integration provides key benefits that streamline operations, enhance visibility, and improve troubleshooting capabilities.

What It Does
Device-Level Visibility:
By associating device names with their respective IP addresses, the integration allows you to identify individual devices performing DNS queries. Instead of seeing just an IP address in logs and analytics, youâ€™ll see human-readable device names, making it easier to track activity.

Simplified Troubleshooting:
When an issue arises, you can pinpoint the exact device (e.g., a laptop or a server) responsible for the query. This speeds up the troubleshooting process and minimizes downtime.

Enhanced Reporting:
With DNS lookup integration, Whalebone DNS provides reports that are tied directly to devices, not just generic IP addresses. This makes your analysis more actionable and meaningful.

Granular Policy Application:
Policies can be applied based on specific devices or users rather than just IP addresses. This gives you finer control over your network security and allows for tailored access rules.

Why Turn It On
Improved Network Monitoring:
Gain detailed insights into network activity with device names, which is especially valuable in large environments where managing IP addresses alone is challenging.

Better Security Management:
Identify specific devices involved in malicious or suspicious activity, helping you mitigate threats more effectively.

Streamlined Administration:
By linking Active Directory with Whalebone DNS, IT administrators can manage DNS queries and security policies with device-level precision.


DNS lookup integration can be simply done in a few steps.
Head to the Whalebone portal -> Resolvers

   :align: center

Click on the resolver you would like to integrate and then head to the Integrations tab on the left of the page.

.. image:: ./img/ad-integration-2.png
   :align: center
   

Turn the Log device names in your network slider to the On position.

Add  your Authoritative nameservers

If you have multiple controllers you can press on the + sign and add a secondary.

If your network is segmented and each IP range or network segment is associated with a different name server, you can leverage the Network segmentation feature.

By enabling this option, resolver starts to query itself for the PTR records (in order to enrich the logs for the device hostname).

Association of IP ranges with the particular name server is then set up in the DNS resolution settings.

Note: Do not forget that PTR records are entered in the reverse way. See the screenshots below for examples.


This will require you to define specific Name servers for specific domain requests.
You can set these up under DNS resolution settings.

Click on the Go to the DNS resolution settings and set up your desired forwarding rules.

In the Advanced setup you can configure specific behaviors.

   :align: center

Defaults are the recommended values, but they can be adjusted to your specific needs.
Once satisfied with the settings you can click on the Save button on the bottom of the page to save the configuration.
The settings will still need to be applied on the resolver as indicated by the message that will pop up at the top of the page.

Head back to the Resolvers page and apply the configuration on the resolver by pressing the apply configuration button next to your resolver.

What is a PTR record?
A PTR (Pointer) record is a type of DNS record used to map an IP address to a domain name, essentially performing a reverse DNS lookup. Unlike A or AAAA records, which resolve domain names to IP addresses, a PTR record provides the human-readable domain name associated with a given IP address.
PTR records are commonly used for:
Email servers: Ensuring proper reverse DNS resolution for spam filtering.
Network troubleshooting: Identifying hosts by domain names instead of just IP addresses.
Logging and monitoring: Making logs more readable by showing domain names instead of raw IP addresses.
How the DNS Resolver Enriches Logs
DNS resolvers can enrich log data by performing reverse DNS lookups on queried IP addresses. This means that if an IP address appears in a DNS query or response, the resolver may try to resolve its PTR record to display a domain name in the logs.
This enrichment helps by:
Providing better context in logs (e.g., showing example.com instead of 192.168.1.10).
Enhancing security monitoring by making it easier to recognize malicious domains.
Simplifying troubleshooting when analyzing traffic patterns.
Important Note:
PTR records are not visible in the DNS traffic logs. The resolver performs reverse lookups separately from the actual DNS queries made by clients. This means that while the logs may display domain names for certain IP addresses, those lookups are not part of the original DNS transaction.
