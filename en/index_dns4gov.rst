Whalebone DNS is a service for security filtering of DNS traffic. It uses logic on top of own DNS resolvers. 
Such resolvers could be either cloud ones maintained directly by Whalebone, or on-premise software resolvers using cloud just for threat intelligence updates and reporting. 
For threat prevention Whalebone relies on external intelligence sources as well as on own methods.
More information about the product and company is available on the official `Whalebone website. <https://whalebone.io>`_
