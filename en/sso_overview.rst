Single Sign-On (SSO) is a user authentication process that allows users to access multiple applications with one set of login credentials. This means that once a user logs in to one application, they can access other connected applications without needing to log in again. In the context of Whalebone Admin Portal, SSO enables users to authenticate themselves using their existing credentials from a third-party identity provider (IdP). This can enhance security and improve user experience by reducing the need for multiple passwords and logins.

To set up Single Sign-On, you will need to configure your identity provider to work with the Admin Portal. This typically involves creating a new application in your IdP, configuring the necessary settings such as the redirect URI and claims. Once you have these details, you can enter them into the Admin Portal's SSO configuration settings.
